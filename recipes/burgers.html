    <p>Been searching for that perfect burger recipe, but end up making a meatloaf sandwich? Been looking for that 'Wow!' reaction at your next BBQ? Look no more, this simple recipe does just that. I can't count how many have asked/begged for this recipe at my BBQs, so now it's time to share! Serve on buttered and toasted kaiser rolls and condiments of choice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced onion</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>½ pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook and stir onion until nearly translucent, about 4 minutes; remove from heat and cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Mix the beef chuck, lamb, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Divide the mixture into fifths and form each portion into a large burger. Press an indentation in the center of each burger with your thumb to keep burgers flat while cooking. Chill the patties thoroughly, 4 to 8 hours. Allow burgers to warm to room temperature before cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Cook burgers on the hot grill until they show grill marks and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Do not press burgers with a spatula as they cook, and flip only once. Let stand 1 minute before serving.</li>
    </ol>
